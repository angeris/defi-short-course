# Short course: Principles of decentralized finance

\toc

## Overview
In this short four-week course, we aim to give a simple and broad mathematical
overview of the current state of decentralized finance including topics like
stablecoins, automated market making, among others. This course assumes a
reasonable amount of comfort with advanced undergrad or basic graduate courses
in probability, linear algebra, and analysis, though future iterations 
will likely have fewer prerequisites.

## Schedule and syllabus
Lectures are every Tuesday and Thursday from 3:00-4:00 PM, starting on June 14,
2022, at Packard 202. Most lectures will be taught by
[Guillermo Angeris](https://angeris.github.io), but at least one will have a guest
lecturer.

The lectures below are subject to change, but should be reasonably stable.
- Tue (6/14): Basic overview of blockchains and interacting with them ([slides](slides/slides-01.pdf))
- Thu (6/16): Simple applications (NFTs, voting, basic games) and some analyses ([slides](slides/slides-02.pdf))
- Tue (6/21): Basic properties of constant function marker makers ([slides](slides/slides-03.pdf))
- Thu (6/23): "Sophisticated" results in constant function market makers ([slides](slides/slides-04.pdf), [proof of replication](notes/proof-of-replication.pdf))
- Tue (6/28): Miner extractable value and atomicity
- Thu (6/30): Oracles, lending, and stablecoins
- Tue (7/5): Staking and staking derivatives (guest lecture by [Tarun Chitra](https://twitter.com/tarunchitra/))
- Thu (7/7): Optimal routing and order execution (guest lecture by [Theo Diamandis](https://theodiamandis.com))

## Problem sets
Every lecture has a (very short) set of problems associated with it that should
take no more than an hour or so to complete. Of course, given that this is just
a set of lectures, no homeworks will be graded.
